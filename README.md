# A modelling, simulation and optimization project
 Simulated the ongoing London to Birmingham construction train line to optimize operations using greedy climbing and Montecarlo heuristic optimization algorithms to achieve the optimum number of trains and signalling blocks to increase passenger flows and to minimize the overall average travel time.
